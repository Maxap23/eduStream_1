== README

This is the first version of eduStream built with Ruby on Rails.  
Many things will be ported over from PHP development, but many things will newly be created.  

eduStream is a collaborative education tool that uses streams and social media to enhance 
educational experience for the underserved urban youth.  

Phase 1: Teacher and administrator collaboration
Phase 2: Teacher, administrator, student, and parent collaboration
Phase 3: Collaboration and transition to project based learning led with eduStream
Phase 4: Distributed, student-led classes that teach optimal competencies for successful
graduates.
